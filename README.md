# sonad-chrome

## Overview

When reading, there's almost always words I don't know. Pulling out Sõnaveeb or EKI is time-consuming and makes reading just that more frustrating. This is designed to make reading (and hopefully learning!) for non-native speakers easier by allowing you to view definitions and declensions within an in-page tool tip.

A chrome extension to display definitions and declensions for Estonian words in-page. Building with reliance on the API written by @BenediktGeiger https://github.com/BenediktGeiger/sonad-api


## In-progress:
- [ ] Basically everything.
- [ ] Svelte boilerplate chrome extension creation.
- [ ] Typescript wrappers for to sõnad-api.
- [ ] In-browser display panel for definitions and declensions and conjucations. (probably display nouns, adjectives, etc. seperately from verbs.)
- [ ] Optional usage of some machine translation service for definitions in specified language.
