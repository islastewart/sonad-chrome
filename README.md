# sonad-chrome
A chrome extension to display definitions and declensions for Estonian words in-page. Built off the API written by @BenediktGeiger https://github.com/BenediktGeiger/sonad-api

In-progress:
- Basically everything.
- Svelte boilerplate chrome extension creation.
- Typescript wrappers for to sÃµnad-api.
- In-browser display panel for definitions and declensions and conjucations.
--> Probably display nouns, adjectives, etc. seperately from verbs.
